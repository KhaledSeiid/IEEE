# Singly Linked List Implementations and Problem Solutions

This repository contains C implementations of various singly linked list operations and solutions to problems related to singly linked lists from HackerRank.

## Singly Linked List Implementations

- `singly_linked_list.c`: Implementation of a singly linked list with basic operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.

## HackerRank Problems

### 1. Detect whether a linked list contains a cycle

- **Problem Description**: Given a linked list, determine if it contains a cycle. A cycle exists if any node in the linked list points to a previously visited node.

- **Solution**: Implemented in `problem_1.c`.

### 2. Insert a node into a sorted singly linked list

- **Problem Description**: Given a sorted singly linked list and an integer value, insert a new node with the provided value into the correct position in the sorted list.

- **Solution**: Implemented in `problem_2.c`.

### 3. Merge two sorted singly linked lists

- **Problem Description**: Given two sorted singly linked lists, merge them into a single sorted linked list.

- **Solution**: Implemented in `problem_3.c`.
